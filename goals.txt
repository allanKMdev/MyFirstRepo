 My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

Personal Goals:
Build discipline through consistency, manage money smarter, take health seriously, and grow confidence by actually doing things instead of overthinking.

Academic Goals:
Choose a clear direction (tech/business), focus on one main skill, improve grades with steady study habits, and build real projects you can show—not just certificates.

Main Focus for the Year:
Consistency. Small daily actions, no excuses, long-term growth.

That’s the whole game.
